# Google Analytics Customer Revenue Prediction using Machine Learning.
Predict how much GStore customers will spend

The 80/20 rule has proven true for many businessesâ€“only a small percentage of customers produce most of the revenue. As such, marketing teams are challenged to make appropriate investments in promotional strategies. Analyze a Google Merchandise Store (also known as GStore) customer dataset to predict revenue per customer. Hopefully, the outcome will be more actionable operational changes and a better use of marketing budgets for those companies who choose to use data analysis on top of GA data.
